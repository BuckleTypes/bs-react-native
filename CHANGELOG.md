# Changelog of `reason-react-native`

## 0.62.0 - 2020-07-20

The release we all have been waiting for (thanks for you patience)!  
Huge thanks to [@sgny](https://github.com/sgny) which handled most of the
changes directly related to react-native 0.62.

**tl;dr**: this release includes

- breaking changes related to `reason-react@0.8`
- breaking changes related to `bs-platform@7` (say bye to most `##` accessors in
  favor of `.`)
- breaking changes related to `react-native@0.62` (say bye to removed
  components)

So in order to upgrade to this release you need to upgrade all this dependencies
at the same time. Be sure to respect
[`peerDependencies`](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/blob/0.62.0/package.json#L4)
before reporting issue.

### ðŸš€ Upgrades & ðŸ’¥ Breaking changes

  ([#674](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/issues/674))
  ([#693](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/issues/693))

  [@cknitt](https://github.com/cknitt)  
  We have converted `Js.t` objects to records where possible (we had to skipped
  objects that rely on `[@bs.meth]`). This means you will have to change a lot
  of `##` notation to just a dot (`.`) to access properties.

  and VirtualizedSectionList

  [@sgny](https://github.com/sgny)  
  These components are interrelated in the sense of being based on each other
  and inheriting props, however, applicable methods are not inherited quite so
  consistently. We removed unavailable methods from each component.
