title: Hello Reason React Native
---

Today is a big day for the ReasonML community as we are releasing the fruits of
a long effort started 3 months ago. As more & more people where starting to use
ReasonML on production apps using React Native, we wanted to make the
BuckleScript bindings for React Native, known has `bs-react-native`, more
accessible. This would have involve several breaking changes in order to
simplify some APIs that have been designed with a high level of security in
mind, but at a cost. The cost of being harder to start with for new comers to
ReasonML.

While some of us were thinking about some simplifications, some others, involved
in Reason React incoming changes, directly started a new approach for this
bindings, following
[the zero-cost approach offered by reason-react 0.7.0](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/blog/2019/04/10/react-hooks).

[CCA](https://github.com/cca-io) started this effort on what is now know as the
new `reason-react-native` bindings, that remove most of the additional
JavaScript code produced by the bindings.

## Zero-cost

We mean almost zero additional cost. So the code you produce with the bindings
will most of the time directly hit React Native JavaScript without an additional
cost on top of it.

Here are some random example

- [`bs-react-native` `View`](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-react-native/blob/958cd4e3a5ffa303304a0b2404cd53b5f49e649f/bs-react-native/src/components/ViewProps.bs.js)
  vs
  [`reason-react-native` `View`](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-react-native/blob/958cd4e3a5ffa303304a0b2404cd53b5f49e649f/reason-react-native/src/components/View.bs.js)
- [`bs-react-native` `Style`](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-react-native/blob/958cd4e3a5ffa303304a0b2404cd53b5f49e649f/bs-react-native/src/style.bs.js)
  vs
  [`reason-react-native` `Style`](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-react-native/blob/958cd4e3a5ffa303304a0b2404cd53b5f49e649f/reason-react-native/src/apis/Style.bs.js)
- [`bs-react-native` `Platform`](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-react-native/blob/958cd4e3a5ffa303304a0b2404cd53b5f49e649f/bs-react-native/src/platform.bs.js)
  vs
  [`reason-react-native` `Platform`](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-react-native/blob/958cd4e3a5ffa303304a0b2404cd53b5f49e649f/reason-react-native/src/apis/Platform.bs.js)

Some modules are even empty or with some minor `require()` that can be themself
almost empty & easily removed by some JavaScript bundlers.

How cool is that?

## But why`reason-react-native` ?

`bs-react-native` already had multiples breaking changes in the past & we didn't
really wanted to offer a poor experience by creating a new release with tons of
changes that won't be easy to codemod (or would require much more work from us).

On top of that, `reason-react` latest release already added an important
breaking change with
[JSX 3](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/jsx).

That's why we had this idea about offering a easy & smooth transition by
offering 2 packages to say goodbye to `bs-react-native` without pain.

- `bs-react-native-jsx3-compat`
- `reason-react-native`

## Wait, what is `bs-react-native-jsx3-compat` ?

`bs-react-native` is using JSX 2 so in order to use it with JSX 3 we would have
to create bindings for the bindings to offer both JSX 2 & 3 bindings. And since
we wanted to go away with some current APIs of `bs-react-native` we started to
think about a new approach.

We know that we wanted to:

- offer to `bs-react-native` users a migration plan, so they can start very
  easily to use JSX 3 & new `reason-react` (so they can use hooks),
- offer new `reason-react-native` bindings, more accessible & with a zero cost
  approach.
- offer a smooth transition between this 2 packages so people can slowly upgrade
  their codebase without having to make an insane PR that switch from one to the
  other.

We don't want your co-workers to hate you with a PR that comes directly from
hell ðŸ˜….

That were we thought about offering `bs-react-native-jsx3-compat`. It's a
package that have the same APIs has `bs-react-native` but that use
`reason-react-native` under the hood.

**This means you will have to make a migration from JSX 2 to 3**. That's the
only thing you will have to do, then with a single change from `bs-react-native`
with `bs-react-native-jsx3-compat` in your `bs-dependencies` you will be ready
to use hooks & directly benefit of (almost) zero-cost bindings!

And since we care about you & don't want you to upgrade from JSX 2 to 3 by hand,
we got you covered with a script that comes right the heart & help you with
that.

[You will find all the required instructions to migrate from `bs-react-native` to `bs-react-native-jsx3-compat` in our documentation](/reason-react-native/en/docs/migration/jsx3/).

## tl;dr

- `bs-react-native` has now entered a frozen state & won't receive any upgrade
- `bs-react-native-jsx3-compat` allows you to use existing code based on
  `bs-react-native` with `reason-react` 0.7.0 & JSX 3
- `reason-react-native` package contains the new bindings for React Native, that
  offers more accessible APIs & that is almost zero-cost
- [We offers you an easy & smooth migration plan so you can start using `reason-react-native` & slowly say by to `bs-react-native`](/reason-react-native/en/docs/migration/jsx3/).

## Thanks

This required effort has been keeping us busy for weeks & won't be possible
without the following people

- CCA team & especially @cknitt for leading us to the right direction for the
  new zero-cost bindings & all the contributions that goes with this move
- @sgny for all his contributions on the new bindings
- @MoOx for leading the effort, the compat layer & the new website you are
  seeing here
- @bloodyowl for his magical
  [reason-react-compat](https://github.com/bloodyowl/reason-react-compat) layer
  &
  [the alternate JSX 3 upgrade path](https://bloodyowl.github.io/blog/2019-04-19-an-alternative-migration-path-for-reason-react/)
  that goes with it
- all the people that helped us on Discord & GitHub in various code review &
  improvements like the react native template (thanks @dawee)

## What's next?

Now that `reason-react-native` is ready to be used & that our migration plan is
usable, we will probably be focused documentation as lot's of APIs & Components
needs to be documented.
