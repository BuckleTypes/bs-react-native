## Getting started

Here are some more things which will be probably useful for you:

- [Reason-React Documentation](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/)
- [Bucklescript Manual](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html)

## Can I really build my React Native app with Reason?

Yes! Check out the [Seattle JS Conf App](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/seattlejsconf-app) for a real world App written with Reason.

### Disclaimer

There are some components and APIs missing. But fear not; you still can use uncovered APIs through JS ffi. You can find an overview of the implemented components and APIs [here](STATUS.md). Contributions of Components and APIs are very welcome! The bindings are targeted to React Native **0.46+**.
