# bs-react-native-jsx3-compat

Compatibility legacy bindings for jsx3 usage

This bindings make sense if you upgrade your codebase to jsx3 but don't want to
directly migrate to reason-react-native at the same time (which is totally
understandable).

To help you migrate, we advise you to look at this method

# PREFER CONTRIBUTING TO reason-react-native

Current stable `bs-react-native` (and jsx3-compat ) has entered a kind of frozen
mode. We are focusing on the rewrite, which is in `reason-react-native` & we
would prefer to get contribution in there. If that's necessary for you to get
something in `bs-react-native`, we would accept it as soon as we also have it
(already or added) in `reason-react-native`.
